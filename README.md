**Before starting, please review the [GitHub Projects: How-to Guide](https://github.com/SOEN-341-Project/Online-Shopping-Website/blob/7464f2cce2d6086d896a20e5abc670403e24e762/GitHub%20Projects%20-%20How-to%20Guide.md).**

## Brief Description
Online shopping has become increasingly popular due to the covid crisis affecting the whole word. While there is a plethora of online shopping websites available to the public, most websites only cater to customers who are most accustomed to their standard currency of their country. Our innovative vision is to create a shopping website solely dedicated to customers who wish to buy products with dogecoin. Our shopping website will allow users to login as a customer, seller, or admin.

Customers will be capable of browsing all products listed by sellers on our website, add their desired products to their cart, and then checkout to pay with dogecoin.

Sellers will be capable of posting their products for sale onto our website, and see a statistical analysis of their overall performance.

Admins will have access to all user profiles, users' order histories, and details of sales.
