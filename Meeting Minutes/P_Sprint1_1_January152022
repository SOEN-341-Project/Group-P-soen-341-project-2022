Meeting 1

Review on work to date:
Templates for Issues, Kanban

Sample PR: automatic issue tracking 
If you're making a PR, put $ and the issue title.
You can link sub issues as well
To close an issue, put keyword: closes
(see templates!)

2 reviews are needed to merge, it should auto-assign and send emails to random team members emails to ensure good quality code

went over labels created, assign a label to your work to keep everything organized
(team label in order to ping two people from the team)

put anything you're working on (in development) as a draft PR or a PR

(issue = ticket, as well as issue etc.)
